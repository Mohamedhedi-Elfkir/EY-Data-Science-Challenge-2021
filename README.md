# EY-Data-Science-Challenge-2021
Our submission for the better working world data challenge organized by Ernst &amp; Young. Data supplied by European Space Agency and NASA.

Training Dataset: 129 Line-scan images (infra-red images taken from an airplane) of bushfires in Victoria, Australia, during the first three months of 2019. There are also polygons showing where the fire is in each image, hand drawn by EY collaborators at the Country Fire Authority (CFA). These polygons are the ground truth the solution, that we were required to recreate.

Test Dataset: 5 additional Line-scan images without fire boundaries.

### 1) Visualizing Raw Data
